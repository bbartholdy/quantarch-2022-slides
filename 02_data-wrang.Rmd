## Dataset

House pits at the Mississippian Snodgrass site in Butler County, Missouri, U.S.A.

Download *House Pits Missouri.xlsx* from Brightspace and store the file in a folder `data/raw_data`.

`r emo::ji("danger")` **DO NOT TOUCH THIS FILE** `r emo::ji("danger")`  
Make a copy of the file and call it `house-pits_cleaned.xlsx`

## Exercise

### Fix problems with the data

What issues might you encounter with the data as is?

Is it machine-readable?

Is it human-readable?

---

## Save data

Save the cleaned data as `house-pits_cleaned.csv`

--

Why `*.csv`? (comma separated values)

--

FA-**I**-R data

- **Interoperability:** non-propritary data format

---

## Uploading data to R

There are multiple ways to upload data to R.

Base R

```r
read.table  # for *.txt files
read.csv    # for *.csv files
read.csv2   # for *.csv files separated by ';'
```

tidyverse (specifically the **readr** package)

```r
read_delim  # for multiple file-types
read_csv    # for *.csv files
read_csv2   # for *.csv files separated by ';'
read_tsv    # for *.tsv files (tab separated values)
```

There are also functions to upload *.xlsx* files, but we won't be using those.

## Exercise

Install the **here** and **tidyverse** packages

**Note:** linux users may have to install the following dependencies:

`libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev libxml2-dev`

--

### Solution

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("here")
install.packages("tidyverse")
# or
install.packages(c("here", "tidyverse"))
```

---

## Loading packages

To upload the data, we will use the **here** and **readr** packages

**readr** is installed with **tidyverse**

--

Every time we start R(Studio), only essential packages are loaded

This allows R to be light-weight, since it only loads a few packages on startup

--

We can use the `library` function to load packages

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(here)
```

---

## (Not) Loading packages

We can also use functions without loading the package by explicitly calling
the package that contains the function

```{r eval=FALSE}
# library(readr)
readr::read_csv(here("<path/to/cleaned/data.csv>"))
```

This is useful if we only need a single function from a package

---

## Uploading our data

Now we can use **here** and **readr** to upload our data

```{r include=FALSE}
pits_data_raw <- readr::read_csv(here("assets/data/house_pits_missouri.csv"))
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
pits_data_raw <- readr::read_csv(here("data/raw_data/house_pits-clean.csv"))
```


The `here` function ensures that our filepaths always start at the project root,

no matter where we are in the project directory

**Note**: when uploading data with **tidyverse** functions,

the resulting data will be in a *tibble* (a special type of data frame)

## Metadata

```{r echo=FALSE}
data.frame("variables" = names(pits_data_raw), 
           "description" = c("East grid location of house in feet (excavation grid system)",
                             "South grid location of house in feet (excavation grid system)",
                             "House length in feet",
                             "House width in feet",
                             "Three areas within the site 1, 2, 3",
                             "Location within or outside the 'white wall' Inside, Outside",
                             "Area in square feet",
                             "Number of projectile points",
                             "Number of abraders",
                             "Number of discs",
                             "Number of earplugs",
                             "Number of effigies",
                             "Number of ceramics"
                                                                 )) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```


---

First we can take a look at the `str`ucture of our data

```{r data-structure, eval=FALSE}
str(pits_data_raw)
```

--

```{r data-structure-output, echo=FALSE}
str(pits_data_raw)
```

---

See Any issues? 

`r emo::ji("bulb")` **Hint:** Recall the conversion of vectors.

```{r data-structure-2, echo=TRUE}
str(pits_data_raw)
```

---

To fix this, we can add an argument to our upload:

--

```{r pits-na, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE}
pits_data_raw <- readr::read_csv("assets/data/house_pits_missouri.csv", na = "N/a")
str(pits_data_raw)
```

```{r pits-na-output, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
pits_data_raw <- readr::read_csv("assets/data/house_pits_missouri.csv", na = "N/a")
str(pits_data_raw)
```

---

The `na` argument in the `readr::read_csv("house_pits_missouri.csv", na = "N/a")` code lets us indicate how missing values are recorded in the raw data

--

and converts them to the proper format for missing values in R

--

which is `NA`.

--

That took care of most of the type issues.

## Changing variables

The `Segment` and `Inside` variables are currently *numeric* and *character*,

and should probably be *categorical*.

--

This can be done in base R with:

```{r base-r-factor, eval=TRUE}
# We don't want to change the raw data frame...
pits_data <- pits_data_raw # ...so we create a copy
# index the target variable and assign to it the corrected variable
pits_data$Inside <- as.factor(pits_data$Inside)
```

--

```{r variable-inside-factor}
pits_data$Inside # print just the 'Inside' variable
```

---

## Changing variables

The `Segment` and `Inside` variables are currently *numeric* and *character*,

and should probably be *categorical*.

Or with the **tidyverse** using `mutate()`:

```{r mutate-factor, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
pits_data <- mutate(pits_data_raw, Inside = as.factor(Inside))
```

```{r}
pits_data$Inside
```

---
background-image: url(assets/img/dplyr_mutate_blank.png)
background-position: right
background-size: contain

## Mutate

.pull-left[
`mutate()` allows you to modify existing variables,

and make new variables.
]

---

## Mutate

We can also change the `Segment` variable in the same function:

```{r mutate-segment-too}
pits_data <- mutate(pits_data_raw, 
                            Inside = as.factor(Inside),
                            Segment = as.factor(Segment))
pits_data$Segment
```

---

## Mutate

We can also change the `Segment` variable in the same function:

```{r mutate-segment-too-2, eval=TRUE}
pits_data <- mutate(pits_data_raw, 
                    Inside = as.factor(Inside),
                    Segment = as.factor(Inside))
pits_data$Segment
```

---

## Mutate

We can also change the `Segment` variable in the same function:

```{r mutate-segment-too-3, eval=FALSE}
pits_data <- mutate(pits_data_raw, 
                    Inside = as.factor(Inside),
                    Segment = as.factor(Inside))
pits_data$Segment
```

So what's going on here? `r emo::ji("monocle")`

--

```{r mutate-skeleton, eval=FALSE}
pits_data <- mutate( <data frame with variables> ,
                     <new variable> = <modification> ,
                     <new variable> = <modification> ,
                     <new variable> = ...etc )
```

---

## Mutate

We can also change the `Segment` variable in the same function:

```{r mutate-segment-too-4, eval=FALSE}
pits_data <- mutate(pits_data_raw, 
                    Inside = as.factor(Inside),
                    Segment = as.factor(Inside))
pits_data$Segment
```

We could also have assigned the changes to a new variable:

```{r mutate-new-variables, eval=FALSE}
pits_data <- mutate(pits_data_raw,
                    Inside_fct = as.factor(Inside),
                    Segment_fct = as.factor(Inside))
```

---

## Indexing data frames/tibbles

You may have noticed we have been using the 'dollar symbol', `$`

This is a way to index data frames (and tibbles) by variable name

```{r}
pits_data$Segment
```

---

## Indexing data frames/tibbles

We can also use square brackets: `dataframe[<rows>,<columns>]`

```{r}
pits_data[,5] # index all rows and 5th column
```

---

## Indexing data frames/tibbles

We can also use square brackets: `dataframe[<rows>,<columns>]`

```{r eval=FALSE}
pits_data[,5] # index all rows and 5th column
```

We needed to know that the `Segment` variable was the 5th column,

so sometimes it's easier to index by name

--

What's the difference between the two outputs? (hint: use `class` function)

---

## Summary statistics

We can summarise our data to get an overview.

Let's see what the `mean` value is for the `Area` variable:

--

```{r summarise-alone, eval=FALSE}
#summarise(pits_data, mean = mean(Area))
mean(pits_data$Area)
```

--

```{r summarise-alone-output, echo=FALSE}
#summarise(pits_data, mean = mean(Area))
mean(pits_data$Area)
```


--

`NA`? That doesn't seem right...

--

```{r summarise-alone-na}
mean(pits_data$Area, na.rm = T) # that's better
```

---

## Summary statistics

```{r summarise-alone-na-2}
mean(pits_data$Area, na.rm = T)
```

This is not particularly informative.

---

## Summary statistics continued

More interesting would be to see if there is a difference between houses
located `Inside` or `Outside` the "white wall".

--

To achieve this, we could `filter` the data before taking the `mean`:

--

```{r summarise-inside}
filter(pits_data, Inside == "Inside") # filter with conditional statement
```

---

## Summary statistics continued

More interesting would be to see if there is a difference between houses
located `Inside` or `Outside` the "white wall".

```{r summarise-inside-assign}
pits_data_inside <- filter(pits_data, Inside == "Inside")
mean(pits_data_inside$Area, na.rm = T)
```

---

## Summary statistics continued

More interesting would be to see if there is a difference between houses
located `Inside` or `Outside` the "white wall".

And now the houses 'Outside':

--

```{r summarise-outside-assign}
pits_data_outside <- filter(pits_data, Inside == "Outside")
mean(pits_data_outside$Area, na.rm = T)
```

---

## Summary statistics continued

More interesting would be to see if there is a difference between houses
located `Inside` or `Outside` the "white wall".

Then compare

```{r compare-location-means}
mean(pits_data_outside$Area, na.rm = T)
mean(pits_data_inside$Area, na.rm = T)
```

There's got to be an easier way to `summarise`... `r emo::ji("wink")`

---
class: inverse

## Break!

---

## Summarise

Enter the `summarise` and `group_by` functions from **dplyr**!

--

A more convenient way to get summary statistics for different groups,

is to use the `group_by` function.

--

This allows you to use a group variables (factors) without `filter`ing:

```{r group-by}
pits_data_grouped <- group_by(pits_data, Inside)

summarise(pits_data_grouped, 
          mean = mean(Area, na.rm = T)) # summarise with the mean function
```

The `summarise` function provides a new *tibble* with the summary statistics.

---

## Summary statistics continued, the final chapter, the sequel

What did we do?

--

```
pits_data_outside <- group_by( <data to group> , 
                                    <variable(s) to group by> )

summarise(<data to summarise>,
          <new variable for output> = <function>(<variable>) )
```

---
class: inverse

## Exercise

Get the mean values for the `Points` variable for houses and `group_by` the `Inside` variable.

--

### Solution

```{r summarise-exercise}
pits_data_grouped <- group_by(pits_data, Inside)
summarise(pits_data_grouped, mean = mean(Points, na.rm = T))
```

---

## Renaming variables

The `Inside` variable name is really starting to annoy me...

`r emo::ji("bulb")` The variable name should not be the same as a value within that
variable.

let's `rename` it:

```{r}
pits_data_renamed <- rename(pits_data, Location = Inside)
```

## Pipes

We have accumulated a few intermediate data frames.

```{r show-data}
ls() # list all elements in the Global Environment
```

This can be avoided (to some extent) with the 'pipe' operator `%>%`

(loaded with tidyverse).
]

---

## Pipes

The pipe allows us to perform multiple operations in a single ...

Let's recap what we have done so far:

```{r summarise-pipe}
pits_data <- pits_data_raw %>%
  mutate(Segment = as_factor(Segment),
         Inside = as_factor(Inside)) %>%
  rename(Location = Inside) 
# We don't want to store the summary output
pits_data %>%
  group_by(Location) %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(Points, na.rm = T))
```

The data `pits_data_raw` is 'piped' through to all subsequent functions.

---

## Pipes

Think of it as saying

```r
take 'pits_data', and then
  filter by 'Inside', and then
  take the mean Area of all 'Inside'
```

.center[ ![](https://media.giphy.com/media/bzaEWi1Z1xzby/giphy.gif) ]

---
class: inverse

## Exercise

Find the `median` values of `Ceramics` for each `Segment`

--

## Solution

```{r median-solution}
pits_data %>%
  group_by(Segment) %>%
  summarise(median = median(Ceramics, na.rm = T))
```

---

## New variables

<!-- Easier to do in long or wide form?? -->

We may be interested in creating a new variable that has the total number
of artifacts.

So for each row, we will need the sum of artifact variables.

--

```{r rowwise-sum, eval=FALSE}
pits_data %>%
  rowwise() %>% # we want to calculate each row separately
  mutate(total = sum(
    c_across(Points:Ceramics), # we want to sum these variables
    na.rm = T))
```

--

```{r rowwise-sum-out, echo=FALSE}
pits_data %>%
  rowwise() %>% # we want to calculate each row separately
  mutate(total = sum(
    c_across(Points:Ceramics), # we want to sum these variables
    na.rm = T)) %>%
  select(!c(Length, Width,Segment, Location))
```

---

## New variables

The 'tidyverse' way is not always easiest...

```{r base-rowwise, eval=TRUE}
pits_data$total <- rowSums(pits_data[,8:13], na.rm = T)
```

```{r base-rowwise-out, echo=FALSE}
pits_data %>%
  select(!c(Length, Width, Segment, Location))
```

## Tidy data

The current data format we are working with is known as 'wide'.

Wide data has individuals as rows, and variables as columns.

In tidy data (a.k.a. 'long' data), the result of a single observation forms a row,

meaning the results from a single individual may span multiple rows.]

## Pivoting

There are two pivot functions to switch between 'long' and 'wide'

- `pivot_longer`
- `pivot_wider`

Pretty self-explanatory...

.center[ ![](https://media.giphy.com/media/oCjCwnuLpiWbfMb1UA/giphy.gif) ]

---

## Pivoting

```{r pivot-setup, include=FALSE}
pits_data_long <- pits_data %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = Points:total, names_to = "artifact", values_to = "count")
```

Let's try pivoting our data with `pivot_longer`

--

- `cols` is a vector of the variables we want to transform

- `names_to` is the name of the new column where we want to store the variable names

- `values_to` is the new column where we want to put the values of our variables

--

```{r pivot-longer, eval=FALSE}
pits_data_long <- pits_data %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = Points:total, names_to = "artifact", values_to = "count")
```

--

```{r pivot-longer-out, echo=FALSE}
pits_data %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = Points:total, names_to = "artifact", values_to = "count")
```

---

.pull-left[
## What just happened?

We have combined all the artifact variables to two columns.

By doing this we have made the data frame longer.]

.pull-right[
```{r pivot-longer-out2, echo=FALSE}
pits_data %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = Points:total, names_to = "artifact", values_to = "count") %>%
  select(!c(Segment, Location)) %>%
  kableExtra::kable() %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling() %>%
  kableExtra::column_spec(6, background = "yellow") %>%
  kableExtra::column_spec(7, background = "orange")
```
]

---

.pull-left[
## What just happened?

We have combined all the artifact variables to two columns.

By doing this we have made the data frame longer.

This gives us a row for every type of artifact within a house.

]

.pull-right[
```{r pivot-longer-out3, echo=FALSE}
pits_data %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = Points:total, names_to = "artifact", values_to = "count") %>%
  select(!c(Segment, Location)) %>%
  kableExtra::kable() %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling() %>%
  kableExtra::row_spec(1:6, background = "yellow") %>%
  kableExtra::row_spec(7:12, background = "orange")
```
]

---

## Pivoting

We can restore it to the wide format using `pivot_wider`

We use `names_from` to re-create the variable names

and `values_from` to re-create the values.

```{r pivot-wider}
pits_data_long %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = artifact, values_from = count)
```

---

## Summarising long format

We can now easily `summarise` the artifact counts.

```{r summarise-long}
pits_data_long %>%
  group_by(artifact) %>%
  summarise(total = sum(count, na.rm = T))
```

Again, not particularly informative...

---
class: inverse

## Exercise

Find the `mean` number of each `artifact` for all levels of the `Location` variable.

`r emo::ji("bulb")` **Hint:** `group_by` accepts multiple arguments.

--

### Solution

```{r long-exercise}
pits_data_long %>%
  group_by(artifact, Location) %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(count, na.rm = T))
```

---

## Exporting the processed data

```{r include=FALSE}
write_csv(pits_data, file = "assets/data/pits-data.csv")
write_csv(pits_data_long, file = "assets/data/pits-data_long.csv")
```

We can save our data as a `.csv` file using `write_csv`

```{r export-data, eval=FALSE}
write_csv(pits_data, file = here("data/derived_data/pits-data.csv"))

write_csv(pits_data_long, file = here("data/derived_data/pits-data_long.csv"))
```
